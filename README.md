# CBL Mariner Vulnerability Data

This repository contains OVAL documents describing vulnerabilities detected in the package repositories for the [CBL-Mariner](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner) project and its associated UI repository.

These documents are generated by comparing package manifests against the [NVD CVE database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and are generally updated several times daily.
Each file is named based on the source branch and project they're built on; the latest development branch OVAL file will 
generally not correspond to the latest available stable release for a project.

Information on the OVAL format can be found [here](https://oval.mitre.org/language/about/overview.html).
